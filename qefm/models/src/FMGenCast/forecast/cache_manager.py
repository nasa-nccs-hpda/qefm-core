# Implements a 'cache manager', providing a read and write wrapper for a backing ZArr
# (xarray format).  This manager includes support for a MutableMapping 'store' factory
# (default DirectoryStore), allowing transparent support for database or network-backed
# ZArr arrays.

# This CacheManager does not implement multithread/multiprocess locking, so it should be
# used only in serial.
